# The art of data preprocessing
This repo is a follow up for the session of "The art of data preprocessing" I conducted in Keras Community Day Nashik 2023. It has all the resources I took information and code from and also has some resources as a suggestion to continue learning.

**Heyy there! I'm still working on it. Check out a couple of days later again!**
